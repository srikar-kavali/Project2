December, 6th 2025 10:54 pm - Initial thoughts and setup

Thoughts so far
Starting Project 2. This is my first Prolog project, so I need to review and understand Prolog's logic programming paradigms and how it is different from other impoerative languages. 

Key Requirements:
- Main Predicate: find_exit/2 where the first parameter is the maze and the second is a list of actions
- The Maze is a list of rows, where each row is a list of cells (f, w, s, e)
- The Actions are left, right, up, down
- You have to validate the maze. There must be one start, and at least one exit

Challenging parts:
- Properly using unification and backtracking
- Avoiding infinite loops in the pathfinding
- Making sure validation happens before solving

Plan
- Set up git repo and initial devlog
- Study example files to understand maze format
- Create basic file structure
- Start with maze validation predicates
